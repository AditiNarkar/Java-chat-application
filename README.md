**Java Socket programming** - Java Socket programming is used for communication between the applications running on different JRE. Java Socket programming can be connection-oriented or connection-less.
Socket and ServerSocket classes are used for connection-oriented socket programming and DatagramSocket and DatagramPacket classes are used for connection-less socket programming.
The client in socket programming must know:
1.	IP Address of Server
2.	Port number

Here, one-way client and server communication is made. In this application, client sends a message to the server, server reads the message and prints it in server screen. Here, two classes are being used: Socket and ServerSocket. The Socket class is used to communicate client and server. Through this class, we can read and write message. The ServerSocket class is used at server-side. The accept() method of ServerSocket class blocks the console until the client is connected. After the successful connection of client, it returns the instance of Socket at server-side.
